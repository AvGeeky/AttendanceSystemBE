# Attendez

⚠️ **Currently Under Development**  
Attendez is an early-stage project and is actively being built. While we're excited about its potential, it's **not ready for external contributions yet**.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

- The codebase is evolving rapidly.
- Breaking changes are frequent.
- Documentation and stability are not guaranteed.

Please **do not open Pull Requests or Issues at this time.**

We aim to **open source Attendez more fully in the future**—with contribution guidelines, documentation, and feature roadmaps. Stay tuned!
